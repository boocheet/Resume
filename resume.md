<span style="font-family:Didot; font-size:2em;">About</span>
> I am a Full Stack developer with experience building websites and web applications. I specialize in JavaScript and have professional experience working with Node.js, Express.js, React.js, and PostgreSQL. I love to problem-solve and being a full-stack software engineer allows me to constantly provide solutions for users’ problems. It allows me to be a continuous learner. Because of my background in both Spanish & physics, I possess excellent analytical, quantitative & problem-solving skills. I can synthesize & analyze large quantities of data & present my analysis in an easily understandable form. When faced with a problem I was taught to systematically identify all factors contributing to the problem & work out how those factors interact to solve the problem.
